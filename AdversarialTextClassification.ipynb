I'm twenty six.   What kind of treatments have you had for this low back pain?  Yeah, I got referred to P T, and I went, but only once or twice, um, and if I remember right, they only did the electrical stimulation, and heat.  I see, how has your pain progressed over the last eight years?  It's been pretty continuous, but it's been at varying degrees, sometimes are better than others.  Do you have any children?  Yes, I had my son in August of two thousand eight, and I've had back pain since giving birth.  Have you had any falls since the initial one?  Yes, I fell four or five days ago while I was mopping the floor.  Did you land on your lower back again? Yes, right onto my tailbone.  Did that make the low back pain worse?  Yes.  Have you seen any other doctors for this issue?  Yes, I saw Doctor X on January tenth two thousand nine, and I have a follow up appointment scheduled for February tenth two thousand nine.\n"
